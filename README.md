# Redis GUI

A desktop GUI client (Mac, Windows & Linux) for Redis built using Electron, React & Rust.

**ðŸš§This project is under development and is not ready for prime time use. ðŸš§**

## Motivation

There are some great free and open source Redis Desktop GUI clients like
[this](https://github.com/qishibo/AnotherRedisDesktopManager). But most of them uses JavaScript for
querying Redis server which is not performant for large collection. This project uses Rust for
querying and interop with JavaScript to provide performance close to the native driver.
