# Redis GUI

A desktop GUI client (Mac, Windows & Linux) for Redis built using Electron, React & Rust.

## Motivation

There are good free and open source Redis Desktop GUI clients like
[this](https://github.com/qishibo/AnotherRedisDesktopManager). But most of them uses JavaScript for
querying Redis server which is not performant for large collection. This project uses Rust for
querying and interop with JavaScript to provide close to native driver performance.
